# Data

Data science without data is like a vision without a strategy. DeployScience can help you solve foundational data challenges and answer critical questions such as:

* what problem areas should I be focused on?
* how do I formulate a strong hypothesis? (and why do I even need to do that?)
* what data should I be collecting?
* how can I store my data cost effectively?
* what about data security, privacy and risk?
