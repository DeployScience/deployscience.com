# Environments

You're already paying for your data scientists, make sure they have the right setup to be effective. DeployScience can help you establish appropriate environments and answer important questions such as:

* what tools are available from our existing cloud providers?
* should data scientists be considered users (like my other analysts) or developers?
* how do I support the ever-growing needs of my data scientists?
* should we limit ourselves to just Python or R? what about other languages like Scala/Julia/Node?
* how does open source work? what about vendor platforms and support?
