# Integrations

Models are most valuable when integrated directly into an existing product, system or process. DeployScience can help you solve critical system architecture challenges and anticipate emergent design patterns such as:

* who is responsible for operating models in production?
* does a microservices approach always work for machine learning? (and does it ever not work?)
* how can we compute predictions more efficiently to meet latency objectives?
* is operationalising a batch scoring process a good idea?
* where is the best place to implement data transformations?
