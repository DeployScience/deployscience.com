# Management

Know upfront what your requirements are once a model is operational and relied upon by your organisation. DeployScience can help you solve key risk management and lifecycle challenges such as:

* how much does it cost to run this model? (and is it worth it?)
* what do I need to monitor to make sure the model is still working?
* should data scientists support their own models or should others be responsible for maintenance?
* how should I adapt my technology strategy to ensure models keep working long-term?
* what do I need to know about a model to meet compliance objectives?
