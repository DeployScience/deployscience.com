# Models

The most successful models are iterated over months and years as your understanding of the problem evolves. DeployScience can help you solve commercial challenges around model development such as:

* what is the best trade-off between speed and complexity?
* should we be measuring with accuracy or is there a more appopriate metric?
* how do I compare a machine learning model to an appropriate baseline?
* what pattern should we follow for controlled experiments? (and do we always need to do that?)
* how can we examine model results to debug issues and improve performance?
